# hello-world
yet another hello world file. just what the world needs. i bet there are more hello-world.txt files (or README.md) than there are people in the civilized world. just a guess. anyhow, i wouldn't be surprised. now there is one more. this one is special, though. mostly because i'm writting it. also, well, because it's self aware. take that generic hello-world.text files.
